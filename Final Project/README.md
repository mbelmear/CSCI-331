## Creative Objective

Our creative objective for the Web Accessibility feature was to enhance the user experience by incorporating key accessibility features into our web project. We aimed to create an inclusive and user-friendly website, ensuring that individuals of all abilities can navigate and interact seamlessly.

## Tech Summary

The Web Accessibility feature is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a Random User Generator. Key accessibility considerations include:

- **HTML Structure:** Proper use of semantic HTML tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` to ensure a well-structured document.
  
- **CSS Styling:** Utilization of CSS for styling, emphasizing readability, color contrast, and link visibility. Relative units (`rem`) are used for font sizing, and links are styled for better visibility.

- **JavaScript Functionality:** The JavaScript code fetches data from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me) and dynamically displays a random user's information on the webpage. The data is presented in a structured format, and the webpage is updated without requiring a full page reload.
